**Note:** If there is a task/bug manager in place to cover this then this file will not be updated.

## Tasks

1. Build home page components 
2. Build history page components
3. Build testimonials page components
4. Build skills page components
5. Build contact page components
6. Replace vh in templates with flexbox

## Issues
1. Tests are not running, it looks like there is a dependency error with react-test-utils.
2. There is some tearing in the rolling-hills.svg file, this is because a gradient was expanded, replace the expanded parts.
