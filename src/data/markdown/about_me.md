I’m Alex (though everyone calls me Foxy), I’m a veteran web developer, who got started way back in 1998, before CSS was even a thing and the world of the web was a simple place. 

I live with my wife and two children (cats are children, right?) in Godalming, Surrey. In my spare time I like to garden (badly), build electronic gizmos and things made from wood and tinker with my smart home.
