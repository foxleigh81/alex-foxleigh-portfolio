If you want to get the best out of me, put me on a brand new project. 

I excel at taking a design concept and using it to build the foundations of a great site, from converting the designs into well-structured, fast, responsive and accessible HTML/CSS, to setting up the front-end to use a nice Front-end Framework (React for example) and integrating it with the back-end all the way to deploying it on the host of your choice.

I can even do the designs myself (this site is an example of my design abilities) although Iâ€™d always recommend hiring someone who specialises in that area.

You can see a full list of my skills on my [skills page](/skills).
