## Introduction  

My portfolio website built to show off my design and development skills. It uses the following tech stack:

- React 16
- GraphQL
- MongoDB
- Apollo
- Jest

This is a work in progress, the old version (built in an older version of React) can be found at http://www.alexfoxleigh.com
