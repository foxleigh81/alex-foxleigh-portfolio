## Introduction  

My portfolio website built to show off my design and development skills. It uses the following tech stack:

- [React 16](https://reactjs.org/)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/)
- [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/)
- [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)
- [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/)

This is a work in progress, the old version (built in an older version of React) can be found at http://www.alexfoxleigh.com
