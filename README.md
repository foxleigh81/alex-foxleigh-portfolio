It's been a while since my last site refresh so here is the latest release. I've stripped a lot back (the previous site had MongoDB, GraphQL and Apollo running, just for a little bit of content!), it's now a basic static site created with React, nothing fancy in the backend, all content is fed from JSON and markdown.

The fanciness in this version comes in the design, this is the first site I've made in years with animation and the first site I've ever made with keyframe animation. It also utilises parallax scrolling whichi I've not done since it first became fashionable back in the early '10 (tenties?, teenies? I feel like our great, great grandparents dropped the ball when they had their turn starting a new century)

## How to run this site

As it's a static site and all the content is from files in this repo, feel free to use it as a boilerplate for your own site. It's super easy to install and run.

**Step 1.** Clone the repo from here.  
**Step 2.** Run `yarn install` (or `npm install`)  
**Step 3.** Run `yarn start` (or `npm start`)  
**Step 4.** Profit.
